# Corruption-And-Human-Development

In this project I recreated a plot from an article which (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption) I found through an RStudio bootcamp program I completed.  

This graph represents the correlation between corruption and development comparing the corruption index with the UN's Human Development Index which includes health, wealth and education. You can read more about it through this link https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption. 

Excel spreadsheet with all necessary details were provided by the RStudio bootcamp.
